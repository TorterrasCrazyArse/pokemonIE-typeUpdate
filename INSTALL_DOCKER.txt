Step 1: use docker build ie on this directory to start building an image using ubuntu as a base with the system dependencies installed.
Step 2: run sudo ./start_docker to access the image with this directory mounted on /pokeemerald.
Step 3: on pokeemerald, run 
        git clone https://github.com/pret/agbcc #to clone agbcc
        cd agbcc #enter the new directory
        ./build.sh #build it
        ./install.sh .. #install
Step 4: after that you should be able to run make on /pokeemerald to build the rom.
