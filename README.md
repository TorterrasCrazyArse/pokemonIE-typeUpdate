# pokemonIE-typeUpdate
A Pokemon Inclement Emerald romhack which throws balance out of the window, featuring bugfixes courtesy of Stephen Lynx

Features:
-A enhaced type chart which somehow is even worse than the original one
-OVERBUFFED many moves and nerfed some (Powercreep isn't real if you just ignore balance)

What might come next:
-New moves and effects
-Extended Post-Game featuring a Sevii Islands like archipielago (and maybe Looker)
-A new super-boss, which is another shameless self-insert
-Along with the new Post-Game, comes more regional forms exclusive to those islands
-And some returning pokemons that weren't available in the og hack
